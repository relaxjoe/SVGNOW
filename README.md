- **Text Color**: Choose a color for the text using either color keywords (e.g., "red") or hexadecimal values (e.g., "#ff0000").
- **Shape Selection**: Choose from a list of shapes (circle, triangle, square) to be included in the logo.
- **Shape Color**: Specify the color of the shape using either color keywords or hexadecimal values.
- **SVG Generation**: Automatically generates an SVG file named `logo.svg` based on the provided inputs.
